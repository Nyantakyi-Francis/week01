        <p>Ghana, situated on the West African coast, is a nation renowned for its rich cultural heritage, particularly 
            as the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence from British rule in 1957, previously known as the Gold Coast. 
            With Accra as its capital, Ghana boasts diverse ethnic groups, with English as the official language. Its economy largely relies 
            on cocoa production, alongside significant gold exports, and is recognized for its vibrant traditional practices and historical landmarks like coastal castles.</p>
